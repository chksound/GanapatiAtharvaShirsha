<blockquote>
    You are the divine truth. You are the only creator of the world. You are the only protector of
    the world. You are the only
    destroyer of the world. You are the ultimate supreme divine power. You are the only soul which
    is
    present partly in each and every living form. Here the meaning of Brahma is related with unknown
    total universal knowledge. The origin of the total universe is sound. The first basic sound or
    knowledge
    is self existent, ever lasting and full of happiness, full of spirit. The pictorial form of this
    original sound is OM and an idol of Ganapati is a symbolic form of OM. All the matter is created
    from the original sound. (Matter is made up of protons, neutrons and electrons) atoms which are.
    It means original soul is present partly in each and everything and it is the ultimate supreme
    knowledge
    means it is the Brahma and. The Brahma (Lord Ganesha) controls from birth till death.

    merit
    of your worshipping to others you protect me. When I am learning your worshipping from the Guru

    The whole world is produced from you. The whole world exists because of you. The whole world
    merged into you. The whole world
    again one can experience in only you. You are the Earth, water, air, fire and sky (the
    panchamahabhutas-the
    five elements). You are the four states of speeches. Sounded soul which is the origin of the
    Lord
    Ganesha is the self existent everlasting unexpressed total universal divine knowledge. The three
    states creation, maintenance (taking care) and destruction are originated from Lord Ganesha
    (Matter
    is originated from sound. The protons, neutrons and electrons are made up of atom. Atom is made
    from
    matter.) Proton, the creator (God Brahma), neutron the care-taker (God Vishnu) and electron the
    destructor
    (God Shiva). The five elements are originated from Lord Ganesha. From Ether the air is
    originated,
    from air the fire is originated, from fire the water is originated, from water the earth is
    originated.
    A human being is also originated from these five elements by processing cosmic energy.

<blockquote>
    Lord Ganesha is the self existent original sounded soul. The knowledge of sound is visible or
    invisible. We can hear it but
    cannot see or feel it. Lord Ganesha (sound) is soul and the universe is the body. The source of
    words
    is from Lord Ganesha-the original sound. The four states of speeches are para, pashyanti,
    madhyama
    and vaikhari. The place of para is deep down inside the region of naval. The place of pashyanti
    is
    in the heart. The 'Madhyanma' is the throat and 'Vaikhari' is the movement of tongue and lips.
    It
    means the presence of Lord Ganesha (sound) is present in all the objects in the world.

<blockquote>
    You are beyond the three human qualities (Raj, Satva, and Tam). You are beyond the three human
    states (waking, dreaming and
    deep sleep). You are beyond the three states of bodies (gross, stable and causal). You
    constantly
    exist in the place 'Muladhara' in human body. You are the three powers/Shakti (required for
    creation,
    preservation and destruction). The sages always meditate on Lord Ganesha. You are Brahma, you
    are
    Vishnu, you are Rudra, you are Indra, you are Agni/God of Fire, you are Vayu/God of Air, you are
    Surya/Sun, you are Chandra/Moon, you are the Brahma (an organism from all living being) and the
    Earth,
    the Sky, the Heaven and the OM. Human being has three types of qualities- Satva, Raj, and Tam.
    Satva
    means Satvik means pure, holy or God fearing. A person, who is satvik, has always pure, noble
    clear
    thoughts. He is always well behaved well mannered thinking for others. Any type of bad elements
    could
    not disturb him. 'Rajogna' means passionate. A person always thinks about what profit he will
    get
    if will do anything. He always accepts positive results as per his thinking. If he doesn't
    achieve
    it he gets disturb. Could not keep control on his thoughts and mind. 'Tamasi' means hot headed
    irascible.
    A person is very hot tempered, selfish, his thoughts and his world are around eating, drinking,
    sleeping.
    They hurt to others; never take care for anybodies feelings and duties towards anybody. Lord
    Ganesha
    is beyond these three gunas. Lord Ganesha always exists in place of 'Muladhara'. According to
    the
    yoga there are seven 'Chakras'(states) in human body. These 'Chakras' are situated in various
    parts
    of the body. Through meditation a person can awake the power of thinking of body, correct
    decision
    power, through the power of kundalini which is in the 'Muladhara'. Lord Ganesha the supreme
    power
    is situated in 'Muladhara'.
